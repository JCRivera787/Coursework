/*Prompt 2:
Write a function called concatOdds that takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

Expectations:

The concatOdds function should return an array containing only odd numbers in ascending order.
The function should handle different combinations of odd and even numbers correctly.
The function should handle empty input arrays correctly.
The function should handle repeated odd numbers correctly.
Specifications:

The function should return an empty array if both input arrays are empty.
The function should return an empty array if both input arrays contain only even numbers.
The function should return an array containing only the odd numbers from the first input array if the second input array is empty.
The function should return an array containing only the odd numbers from the second input array if the first input array is empty.
The function should return an array containing only the unique odd numbers from both input arrays.
The function should return an array containing repeated odd numbers correctly.
The function should return an array containing only one odd number if both input arrays contain only one odd number.
The function should return the odd numbers in ascending order.*/

/*Prompt 1 :
Create a function named "multiplication" that multiplies two integers and returns their product. Write unit tests to ensure the function handles positive and negative integers, zero, and large numbers.

Expectations:

The multiplication function should return the correct product of its two input integer arguments.
The function should handle positive and negative integers, zero, and large numbers correctly.

Specifications:

The function should return 0 if either input integer is 0.
The function should return the correct product for two positive or negative integers.
The function should return the correct product for a positive and a negative integer.
The function should return the correct product for a positive integer and zero.
The function should return the correct product for a negative integer and zero.
The function should return the correct product for two large positive or negative integers.
The function should return the correct product for a large positive integer and a small negative integer.
The function should return the correct product for a small positive integer and a large negative integer.*/
